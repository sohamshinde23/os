/*
Certainly! Let's go through the entire code step by step so that you can understand the logic behind it.

### Code Overview:

This C program demonstrates three concepts:
1. **Zombie Process**: A process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table because its parent hasn't yet read its exit status.
2. **Orphan Process**: A process whose parent has terminated, so it is adopted by the `init` process (PID 1).
3. **Sum Calculation**: The parent calculates the sum of even numbers from an array, while the child calculates the sum of odd numbers.

### Code Breakdown:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>
```

- **`#include <stdio.h>`**: Includes the standard I/O library for using functions like `printf()`.
- **`#include <stdlib.h>`**: Includes the standard library for functions like `exit()` and `malloc()`.
- **`#include <sys/types.h>`**: Includes the system types needed for system calls, such as `pid_t` for process IDs.
- **`#include <sys/wait.h>`**: Includes functions for waiting for child processes, such as `wait()`.
- **`#include <unistd.h>`**: Includes functions for process control, such as `fork()`, `getpid()`, and `getppid()`.

### Functions Explained:

#### 1. `create_zombie_process()`

This function creates a zombie process:

```c
void create_zombie_process() {
    pid_t pid = fork();  // Create a child process
```

- **`pid_t pid = fork();`**: The `fork()` system call is used to create a new process. This will return:
  - A **positive value** (child's PID) to the parent process.
  - `0` to the child process.
  - `-1` if the `fork()` fails.

```c
    if (pid > 0) {
        // Parent process creates a zombie
        printf("Parent process (PID: %d) created a zombie process (PID: %d)\n", getpid(), pid);
        sleep(1);  // Sleep for 1 second to keep the child as a zombie briefly
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process exits to become a zombie
        printf("Child process (PID: %d) exiting to become a zombie\n", getpid());
        exit(0);  // Child exits immediately, becoming a zombie
    } else {
        perror("Fork failed for zombie process");
    }
}
```

- **Parent Process** (`pid > 0`):
  - The parent prints a message showing it created a child (which will become a zombie).
  - The parent calls `sleep(1)` to wait for 1 second, allowing the child to become a zombie.
  
- **Child Process** (`pid == 0`):
  - The child prints a message and immediately exits with `exit(0)`.
  - Since the parent hasn't yet called `wait()` to collect the childâ€™s exit status, the child remains in the **zombie** state for a short period.

#### 2. `create_orphan_process()`

This function demonstrates the creation of an orphan process:

```c
void create_orphan_process() {
    pid_t pid = fork();  // Create a child process
```

- **`pid_t pid = fork();`**: Again, this creates a child process, returning the process ID (PID) for the parent and `0` for the child.

```c
    if (pid > 0) {
        // Parent exits to make the child an orphan
        printf("Parent process (PID: %d) exiting, creating an orphan process\n", getpid());
        exit(0);  // Parent exits, making the child an orphan
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process becomes orphaned and adopted by init (PID 1)
        sleep(1);  // Sleep for 1 second to show orphan behavior
        printf("Orphan child process (PID: %d) now adopted by init process (PPID: %d)\n", getpid(), getppid());
    } else {
        perror("Fork failed for orphan process");
    }
}
```

- **Parent Process** (`pid > 0`):
  - The parent exits immediately using `exit(0)`, causing the child to become an **orphan**. The orphaned child will be adopted by the `init` process (with PID 1).

- **Child Process** (`pid == 0`):
  - The child sleeps for 1 second to simulate the orphaned state, and then prints that it has been adopted by `init` (i.e., its new parent is `init` with PID 1).

#### 3. `calculate_even_odd_sum(int arr[], int n)`

This function calculates the sum of even and odd numbers in an array using the parent and child processes:

```c
void calculate_even_odd_sum(int arr[], int n) {
    pid_t pid = fork();  // Create a child process
```

- **`pid_t pid = fork();`**: The `fork()` creates a child process that will handle calculating the sum of odd numbers, while the parent calculates the sum of even numbers.

```c
    if (pid > 0) {
        // Parent calculates sum of even numbers
        int even_sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] % 2 == 0) {
                even_sum += arr[i];
            }
        }
        wait(NULL);  // Wait for child process to finish
        printf("Parent process (PID: %d) - Sum of even numbers: %d\n", getpid(), even_sum);
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Child calculates sum of odd numbers
        int odd_sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] % 2 != 0) {
                odd_sum += arr[i];
            }
        }
        printf("Child process (PID: %d) - Sum of odd numbers: %d\n", getpid(), odd_sum);
        exit(0);  // Exit the child process after completing its task
    } else {
        perror("Fork failed for even-odd sum calculation");
    }
}
```

- **Parent Process** (`pid > 0`):
  - The parent calculates the sum of even numbers by iterating through the array. It uses `wait(NULL)` to ensure that it waits for the child to complete its task before printing the sum of even numbers.

- **Child Process** (`pid == 0`):
  - The child calculates the sum of odd numbers and prints the result. After finishing the calculation, the child exits using `exit(0)`.

### `main()` Function:

The `main()` function is where the program executes and calls the functions to demonstrate the behaviors:

```c
int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}; // Hardcoded array of numbers
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);  // Get the size of the array

    // Task 1: Create a zombie process
    create_zombie_process();
    sleep(1); // Sleep briefly to observe the zombie process

    // Task 2: Create an orphan process
    create_orphan_process();
    sleep(1); // Sleep briefly to observe the orphan process

    // Task 3: Calculate sum of even and odd numbers using parent and child process
    calculate_even_odd_sum(arr, n);

    return 0;
}
```

- **Array**: An array of numbers `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}` is used.
- **Size Calculation**: `n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0])` calculates the number of elements in the array.
- **Function Calls**: The three functions (`create_zombie_process()`, `create_orphan_process()`, and `calculate_even_odd_sum()`) are called sequentially.

### Expected Output:
For the array `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}`, the output should be something like this:

```text
Parent process (PID: 1234) created a zombie process (PID: 1235)
Child process (PID: 1235) exiting to become a zombie
Orphan child process (PID: 1235) now adopted by init process (PPID: 1)
Parent process (PID: 1234) - Sum of even numbers: 30
Child process (PID: 1235) - Sum of odd numbers: 25
```

### Summary:

- **Zombie Process**: A child process that terminates but remains in the process table until the parent reads its exit status.
- **Orphan Process**: A child process whose parent terminates. It is adopted by the `init` process.
- **Even/Odd Sum Calculation**: The parent calculates the sum of even numbers, and the child calculates the sum of odd numbers from the array.
